Express middleware for routing requests to HT services. Using this allows you to serve a HTTP API using strictly defined and documentable methods.

## `hte(client, service, method[, data])`

Where `client` is an instance of `ht.Client` that **has already been connected**.

Where `service` is the name of the service you wish to call.

Where `method` is the name of the method you wish to call.

Where `data` is an *optional* array of keys that will be merged from the HTTP `request` object into the data passed to the call. **Defaults to:** `[ 'body' ]`.  You can optionally provide an object, and its properties will be merged into the data.

### Validation errors

If the data collection from a request does not match the schema for a method, the HTTP response code will be set to 400, and the body of the response will be the validation error message.

### Special Response Keys

Returning an object with one of these keys from a method will make the HTTP response behave differently. See the table below.

| Name        | Type   | Description                   |
|-------------|--------|---------
| statusCode  | number | If the response from a service is an object, and has a key statusCode that is a number, the HTTP response code will be set to that value. This key will then be removed from the response. |

### Example

```js
var express = require('express')
var ht = require('hudson-taylor')
var hte = require('ht-express')
var s = require('ht-schema')

// Create a new Local HT service
var transport = new ht.Transports.Local()
var service = new ht.Service(transport)
var client = new ht.Client({
  service: transport
})

// Add a method for the service
service.on("sayHello", s.String(), function (data, callback) {
  var response = 'Hello ' + data
  return callback(null, response)
})

// Create a new express app
var app = express()

// Mount the service method on a url
app.get('/sayhello', hte(client, 'service', 'sayHello'))

// If you hit /sayHello with a string as a json body
// you will get a response that says 'Hello {body}'!
```
